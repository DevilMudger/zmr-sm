# **Zombie Master: Reborn | SourceMod files**

**NOTE: You have to disable gamedata updating in addons/sourcemod/configs/core.cfg, DisableAutoUpdate "yes"**

This is because master.games.txt has to be overridden. Auto-update will reset and won't allow our offsets to be loaded from the file. (custom-folder didn't seem to work when testing.)
